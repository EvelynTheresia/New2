## üìÅ Data Storage

The system loads and saves data from `.csv` files:
- `ApplicantList.csv`
- `OfficerList.csv`
- `ManagerList.csv`
- `ProjectList.csv`
- `ApplicationList.csv`
- `EnquiryList.csv`
- `RegistrationList.csv`

Each entity is mapped to a corresponding loader class (`ApplicationCSVLoader`, `EnquiryCSVLoader`, etc.) which handles file I/O operations.
